# just-my-type

a) How to compile:

    This is an iOS built using Xcode. In order to compile it, the latest version of Xcode must be 
    installed. Download all of the files, launch the program using "JustMyType.xcodeproj" and press 
    the play button in the upper left corner to compile.

b) How to run the code:

    Make sure to select the simulator that you want to use (for example iPhone 6s simulator) or 
    connect apple device to computer before compiling. Then wait for the simulator or device to 
    load the project and automatically start the program.

c) How to run the unit test cases:

    In order to run the unit test cases you can compile the program as you would normally in Xcode and the
    test will run along with the program.

d) Acceptance tests for an external person to try:

    i) Navigate through various menus by clicking buttons and seeing the correct new menu or 
    screen appear.
    ii) Type the correct word into the typing test and see that a new word automatically pops 
    up once this has been accomplished
    iii) Type an incorrect word into the typing test and see that it does not let you continue 
    onto a new word
    iiii) Check to make sure you can reset your score to try again and make sure your high score
    doesn't disapear on exit of the app.
